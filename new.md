title: Proposing an identifier or format
---
Anyone can propose a new challenge for an area where a standard identifier or format for publishing data could be useful.

* [New identifier challenge](https://github.com/WeTheCatalysts/standards-and-identifiers/issues/new?assignees=&labels=identifier&template=identifier-challenge.md)
* [New format challenge](https://github.com/WeTheCatalysts/standards-and-identifiers/issues/new?assignees=&labels=identifier&template=format-challenge.md)

Once a new challenge has been submitted, it is reviewed by the team then opened up for suggestions for how it could be improved from across the charity sector. Then they are published online.

To help, we are developing a [set of principles](principles.md) for data standards in the charity sector.
