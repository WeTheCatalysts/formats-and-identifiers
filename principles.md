---

**Work in progress** — [please edit this document](https://github.com/WeTheCatalysts/standards-and-identifiers/blob/master/principles.md)

1. Use established, open standards, avoid creating new ones
2. Don’t try and model the world, allow for fuzzyness and caveats
3. Monitor adoption, if standards are not taken up, change approach
4. Use formats that help get data to where users already are
5. Be clear when a standard might be inappropriate to use
6. Type of support, geography and audience should be clear
7. Understand the needs of data creators and data users
8. Have a strong bias towards URLs and the web
9. Explain why to use something and who benefits
10. Have an open process for adopting new standards
