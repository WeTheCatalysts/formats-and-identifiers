During the COVID-19 crisis, data has been critical in understanding how to respond. Adopting standard ways of using data across the charity sector could charities better meet the needs of those who rely on them, government make better policy and funders ensure that money is being directed to the right place.

This website is an open catalogue of identifiers and data formats to help charities publish data in a way that is easier to use and link.
