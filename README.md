During the COVID-19 crisis, data has been critical in understanding how to respond. Adopting standard ways of using data across the charity sector could charities better meet the needs of those who rely on them, government make better policy and funders ensure that money is being directed to the right place.

This website is an open catalogue of identifiers and data formats to help charities publish data in a way that is easier to use and link.


##Recommended identifiers and formats

**Identifiers** are standard codes for identifying things like organisations, categories or places. **Formats** are standard ways of publishing data about a thing such as a service provided by a charity, or a funding award.


### Identifiers

* [Identify the nations of the UK that data applies to](identifiers/uk-nations.md)

### Formats

* [Publish information about a service that is provided to the public and the geographical area it covers](formats/service-provision.md)

## Proposing an identifier or format

Anyone can propose a new challenge for an area where a standard identifier or format for publishing data could be useful. 

[New identifier challenge](https://github.com/WeTheCatalysts/standards-and-identifiers/issues/new?assignees=&labels=identifier&template=identifier-challenge.md)

[New format challenge](https://github.com/WeTheCatalysts/standards-and-identifiers/issues/new?assignees=&labels=identifier&template=standard-challenge.md)

Once a new challenge has been submitted, it is reviewed by the team then opened up for suggestions for how it could be improved from across the charity sector. Then they are published online.
